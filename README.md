### Dynamic Hero Text with Animation

- Mapped over the hero text and used Framer Motion to animate each letter by changing the opacity over a set duration.
- Used `useState` and `onMouseEnter` event handlers and a random color generator function to highlight letters from the hero text as you hover your mouse.

### Animated Project Page Nav

- Animated the SVG lines for the nav bar on the project page by changing the path length and opacity and used Path and Line Variants to control the timing, delay, and transition properties for each SVG element.
