        Hi! I&apos;m Jack Crawford, a full-stack developer based in Wellington,
        New Zealand. My recent graduation from Dev Academy Aotearoa has marked a
        significant milestone in my transition from a seasoned account manager
        to full stack developer.
      </p>
      <p className="m-5">
        As someone who has thrived in dynamic account management roles,
        I&apos;ve learnt the importance of customer-centric strategies and the
        power of effective communication. Now, channelling these skills into
        software development, I&apos;ve equipped myself with strong competencies
        in JavaScript, React, TypeScript, Express.js, and more.
      </p>
      <p className="m-5">
        I&apos;m fascinated by how technology can solve complex problems and am
        committed to crafting code that&apos;s not only functional but also
        user-friendly and accessible. In search of a collaborative, innovative
        environment that values agile practices and out-of-the-box thinking,
        I&apos;m eager to bring my unique perspective and dedicated work ethic
        to a team as passionate about technology as I am.
